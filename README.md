# DENIM Downloading

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.unamur.be/denim/downloading/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.unamur.be/denim/downloading/-/commits/master)

## üì£ Description

This application enables to download repositories.

## ‚≠ê Features

Here is a summary of the features currently supported.

### Download (git)

#### Description

The git download enables to retrieve one or several git repositories at once, each according to a given version (hash).

#### How to?

**INPUT**

Invoke the git download by using the [POST /git](http://locahost:3000/git) route with the following input object.

```json
[
  "https://(github|gitlab).com/<user>/<repository>/tree/<hash>",
  "https://(github|gitlab).com/<user>/<repository>/tree/<hash>",
  "..."
]
```

This one represent the list of GitHub/GitLab repositories to download, specific to a given version (hash).

‚ö†Ô∏è Each repository is downloaded according to a given version (hash).

‚ö†Ô∏è Please respect the input object format.

**OUTPUT**

The result of the download is a ZIP file containing as many directories as there are repositories.
The ZIP file also contains a file `denim` that reminds the original repository URL.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development details

### Setup

See [INSTALL file](INSTALL.md).

### Test the app (manually)

Manual test suites are set up thanks through the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) tool.

The tests are specified in the `/test/manual` directory and are named following the `*.test.js` pattern.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that the "maximum response size" in Postman is increased, for example to 1000 MB. `Postman > Settings > General > Max response size > 1000 MB`.

### Test the app (unit testing)

Unit test suites are set up thanks to the [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) framework.

The tests are specified in the `/test/unit` directory and are named following the `*.test.js` pattern.

The configuration of Jest is stated in the `/package.json` file.

The tests running computes the code coverage.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure that test suites are run from a terminal outside an IDE and when no IDE is running with the project open. This will prevent erroneous tests. Indeed, since the tool downloads the git repository in the source files, the IDE that display sources could put a lock on the `.git` directory to update their VCS extensions.

#### Launching the tests

- Launch the unit tests.

  ```bash
  npm run test_unit
  ```

### Test the app (integration testing)

Integration test suites are set up thanks to the [SuperTest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) framework.

The tests are specified in the `/test/integration` directory and are named following the `*.test.js` pattern.

The configuration of Jest is stated in the `/package.json` file.

#### Preparing the environment with Docker

- Launch the application on Docker (cf. [Dockerize the application](#dockerize-the-application)).

#### Launching the tests

- Launching integration tests.

  ```bash
  npm run test_integration
  ```

### Documentation

An autogenerated documentation is available thanks to SwaggerUI
at [http://localhost:3000/docs](http://localhost:3000/docs).

- Generate the documentation.

  ```bash
  npm run swagger
  ```

### CI/CD

A CI/CD process is set up thanks to GitLab CI/CD.
Learn more about GitLab CI/CD via [this page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

This one is described in the `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
‚ö†Ô∏è Right privileges must be granted to Docker on the session on which the CI is executed.

### Linting

- Lint the application.

  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

### Formatting

- Formatting the application.

  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```
